            <h2>Chapter Two: The Weirdest Birthday Ever</h2>

            <P class="first-p">Never In my life had I thought an hour could stretch as long as that class did. In spite of my best efforts, I kept zoning out and my nervousness was just making me more fidgety than usual. About halfway through the class, my stomach began protesting my change in meal scheduling. At home, I would have already snacked several times through the morning, but today I hadn't gotten the chance and my body didn't appreciate it. Despite my effort to ignore the hunger pangs, thinking maybe they would go away, the pain only intensified, and by the time the bell rang I felt like somebody was practicing boy scout knots with my insides, very tight knots, at least my markings were no longer burning, but I had only traded one source of discomfort for another.
            </P>
            <P>Shakily I got to my feet, even from here I could smell the cafeteria and the food, my hunger sharpening my sense of smell. All shyness forgotten, I walked towards the classroom exit, bumping into some of the other students who were also in a rush to get out.
            </P>
            <P>“Hey Asher”, a voice called from behind me. Surprised, I turned to look at Walker, had he read my name off the quiz? seemed like the only explanation since I couldn't remember giving him my name. “Um...yes?”, I asked, impatiently changing my weight from one foot to the other.</P>
            <p>“Hey man wait up, you took off running for the door”, he said with a grin, “I just realize I never got the chance to introduce myself, I'm Jake Walker, sorry if I freaked you out by calling you by your name, I just read it from your quiz. By the way, that's an interesting-sounding name! Where did-”, he stopped himself. “Look at me getting off-topic”, he said, shaking his head and giving me an apologetic smile.  “What I was trying to say was… want to eat lunch together? I'm sure you will get along with my friends”. The thought of who I would sit with during lunch hadn't even crossed my mind, I was so hungry I hadn't even had time to worry about it, but I could hardly refuse his invitation, not after he had helped out and got in trouble for me.
            </p>
            <P>“Okay… Sure”. I said. “Um, lead the way… I'm not sure where the cafeteria is”. That of course was a lie but it would seem weird if I just magically walked there. He smiled, “Great! Let's go!” He said, walking out into the crowded hallway and I realized that even if I hadn't known where the cafeteria was, or rather if I hadn’t smelled it, I could have still gotten there without asking for help as the entire flow of students was moving towards that direction like a giant school of fish.
            </P>
            <P>Again the sound of the hallways assaulted me, I shook my head in an effort to stay focused, just walking with the flow and following Jake, trying to not bump into anybody. Among the chaos of noise I didn’t register the heartbeat approaching that I had already committed to memory, and that’s why I jumped in surprise when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
            </P>
            <p>“Wow there”, Daenerys said, standing behind me, “Didn’t mean to spook you”. I looked at her, guiltily rubbing my neck, I had been in such a hurry to get to the food it hadn't even occurred to me to wait for her as she had promised to help me all through the day. “Hey Dan”, Jake called from ahead of me, fist-bumping the small girl; “You know this guy?” I asked. 
            </p>
            <P>Daenerys’s smile widened, “Sure do”, she said, “Met him this morning in the hall, were you going to the cafeteria?”. “That's great!” Jake said like it was truly the best thing to come out of this century, “So you already met one of my friends Asher, I'm telling you man you are going to fit right in with us…”. He turned back to look at Daenerys, ignoring the dirty looks some people were throwing at us for standing in the middle of the hallway like human roadblocks.
            </P>
            <br>
            <P>“Oh and Dan we are obviously heading toward the cafeteria, thought I was about to pass our lunch break in the library?”. “Of course you wouldn't…”, she said, rolling her eyes at him and, thank the gods, beginning to walk again, “Libraries are for people who can read”. He scoffed at that, walking after her, glancing at me to make sure I was following them,  “Please… remind me, out of the two of us who is in the scientific A.P. courses at the moment?”.
            </P>
            <p>She rolled her eyes at him again, throwing her bangs out her eyes with a quick motion of her head, “Oh please you are barely clinging to life in those… at least I do good in my classes including the a.p ones”. Their bickering went back and forth and I stared in fascination at the both of them, faintly wondering if this is what having friends was like. It looked fun, more fun than I was willing to admit because it meant realizing just how much I had been missing out on.
            </p>
            <P>The crowds only thickened the closer we got to the cafeteria, and the noise became so bad that I clamped my hands over my ears in a futile attempt to get rid of the noise. “Are you okay Asher?” Daenarys asked, turning to look back at me with concern, her voice was barely audible above the myriad of sounds that assaulted me at the moment, but I still tried to play it cool, “Yea, fine. I'm fine”. Her frown deepened, “You sure?”. “Yea… all good”, I said in a tight voice as the lights above us flickered, making some people look up at the long LED light bulbs that served to illuminate the place.
            </P>
            <P>Daenerys still didn’t look convinced, so I lowered my hands from my ears slowly, trying to act like that hadn’t been a big deal, “It was nothing, really”, I said, trying to sound normal this time as I made an effort to get used to the noise. “Okay…”, she began, “If you say so…”. It was clear she didn’t believe me but had decided to drop it; Jake had just stared in silence at me, one eyebrow raised slightly, but unlike Daenerys, he didn’t say anything, for which I was grateful. I wasn’t sure I could have, at the moment, dealt with two people asking me if I was okay at the same time.
            </P>
            <p>Jake and Daenerys lead me to a table that was set more in one of the corners of the place where a single defective light bulb did the trick of making it darker than the rest of the room, the table was already almost full with kids, and a rather peculiar looking group of them. There was a chubby girl with puffy dyed purple hair, big cat-eyed glasses, and wearing heavy makeup, her clothes were as bright and colorful as her hair, all in vibrant shades that she somehow had managed to match.  Beside her was an olive-skinned girl with pretty green eyes, dressed in shades of pink, her hair in pigtails, giving her a young girl aura; she was currently laughing at something the boy sitting beside her had said. He had dark skin and compared to the other two; he was dressed relatively normal with a t-shirt that spelled Broadway in bold black letters - a theatre fan, I deduced.
            </p>
            <P>There were five more kids at the table, plus those three that had first caught my eye. There was a small Asian girl with dyed red hair and a pretty face that made her look like a K-pop star, a tall lanky boy with big fluffy hair that looked even more disorganized than mine, an emo looking girl with a pale face, heavy eyeliner, and black lipstick, a boy dressed like it was still 1995, and finally, a buff looking girl with very short blond hair and greenish-blue eyes who was dressed in loose jeans, a t-shirt, and a red flannel shirt.
            </P>
            <P>The entire table turned to look at us as we approached and all of a sudden, with so many eyes staring at me, my shyness came back with full force, making me barely contain the urge to turn around and walk away out of sight. “Hello everybody”, Daenerys said, sliding into the chair beside the Asian girl. “This is Asher”, she said, waving towards me; “He’s new here”.
            <br>
            </P>
            <p>“Um… Hi.” I said, feeling like I had to say something but finding myself unable to come up with anything more eloquent. My greeting was echoed by a few at the table, who were giving me friendly smiles. “Asher”, Daenerys continued, pointing to everybody, in turn, starting from her right; “This is Yuki”, she said, pointing to the Asian girl who gave me a little wave, “We have Brandon”, she continued, pointing to the lanky boy, “Misses dark and gritty is named Margarita”, she said, earning herself an eye roll from the emo girl and a few snickers from around the table.</p>
            <P>She pointed to the boy dressed in vintage style but he stopped her before she could speak. “I can introduce myself thank you”, he said with mock offense, “My name is Jona”, he said, extending his hand so I could shake it, “Pleasure to meet you, Asher”. “I… uh… pleasure is mine”, I said, trying to hide my impatience. Right now all I could think of was my lunch, I didn’t even care what dad had packed, at the moment I would eat the table if it promised to provide some nutrients.
            </P>
            <P>“I'm Emma”, the girl with the colored hair piped in, “And this is Amelia”, she added, waving towards the pigtail girl who was clearly more similar to me in the fact that she had gone shy the moment I stepped close to the table. “I'm Liam”, the Broadway shirt boy said, taking a bite from an already half-eaten apple, “Good to meet you”. “Dude just sit down”, the girl with the flannel shirt said before I could answer Liam, the only person who hadn't introduced herself, “You look weird just standing there”. “Theo that's not a very nice thing to say”, Jona scolded her, making her scoff. “Um no…”, I began, taking the seat beside Jake, “It's alright”. In truth I was just thankful I could finally eat and couldn't have cared less if the girl had straight-up screamed at me. “See?” she said, making Jona roll his eyes.
            </P>
            <p>She looked at me up and down, the only one at the table who didn't offer me at least a friendly expression, “I would tell you my name but I prefer to go by Theo, that alright with you?”. It didn’t sound like she was asking, more like she was demanding. I shrugged; “Sure...no problem”, I said, barely bothering to look at her as I brought out my lunch box, my mouth watering as the smell of lasagna wafted out from it. Dad had packed me a big portion, or at least as big as he could manage, and still look normal; still, it didn’t look like it was nearly enough, not with the throbbing pain in my insides. I would probably be forced to buy cafeteria food, which didn’t look too promising taste-wise.
            </p>
            <P>I took a big bite of the lasagna, feeling like crying at how good it tasted, well anything would have tasted good to me at the moment, but my dad’s homemade cooking was the best thing in the world.... according to me at least. Around me, the other kids were still studying me, not openly, but I could still feel their glances and side-eyes. Slowly the conversations around the table re-started, a lot of it focused on me. “Where are you from?”, I wasn’t sure, dad had never told me where exactly I had been born, so I lied and said New York, it was the first state that came to mind. Again the topic of my accent came up, and I gave them the same explanation I had given to Daenerys, information that only made them even more curious.
            </P>
            <P>“What did my parents do for a living?” “Would I be staying here in this school for the rest of the year?” “Why change from homeschooling all of a sudden?” “Did I have friends in other countries?” “Could I speak other languages?”. I did my best to answer all of their questions while I ate, but in all honesty, it was exhausting, soon enough I felt like this was a police interrogation that had gone on for hours. 
            </P>
            <br>
            <p>Daenerys seemed to notice my tiredness because slowly she drew the conversation away from me and to other topics, an ability I was beginning to realize, she was quite good at. Through hearing them talk amongst each other, I began finding more about them, first, and more obviously, they were all part of the Theater Club, which did in part explain why they all seemed to have an inclination for the dramatic, it was noticeable even in the way they spoke and interacted with each other.
            </p>
            <P>Secondly, and despite her not being the eldest,  Danerys appeared to be viewed as the leader of the group, her naturally friendly and outgoing personality was probably one of the key factors in uniting this oddball group of people, and lastly, from what I could gather, they were currently working on a big theater production but the school had cut them short of funds so they were brainstorming ways to collect the money they needed.
            </P>
            <P>“It must be nice”, I thought to myself, wondering how much different my life would be if my biggest source of worry was collecting money for a play. Looking around at all of them I began to realize just how crazy my life had been, just how alienated from the normal childhood experience I had been. Could things have been done differently? Could I have been normal? I mean like them, talking and laughing among friends, working together toward something they loved? I looked down at my now almost empty plate, the gloves I whore reminding me that although I could pass as normal, I was still hiding part of me, the part that made me different.
            </P>
            <p>It was not only my markings, my senses were also a lot sharper than a normal human, my skin tough to pierce, and I could snap steel bars like they were twigs. None of that was normal, I had always known that, but sitting there, in the middle of a loud cafeteria surrounded by hundreds of teens,  the magnitude of my own peculiarity hit me head-on and with it, the realization that I wanted to belong, to have friends, to go out and watch movies and laugh at stupid jokes.
            </p>
            <P>Was that too much to ask for? considering how my life had gone so far, probably. I was sure this illusion or normality of going to school and hanging out with other people my age would break soon enough, but for as long as it lasted I found deep within me that I wanted to enjoy it...maybe going to school wasn’t going to be so bad after all.  
            </P>
            <P>As the minutes ticked on and on, one after the other, I could feel my stomach dropping lower and lower. School had finished more than an hour ago, the last bell bringing on a fury of activity as everybody tried to get to their cars or the buses as fast as possible. Considering how nervous my father had looked this morning, despite his best efforts to hide it, I was sure he would be there to pick me up on time. I had walked out of school fully expecting to see our black pickup truck waiting for me. Never had I  expected to find myself in my current predicament. Dad was late to pick me up, incredibly late, leaving me to sit in one of the school's very uncomfortable concrete benches, practically drowning myself in worry.
            </P>
            <p>Calling him proved fruitless, his phone only rang on and on and he didn’t pick up, something he never did, especially if it was a call from me. The added factor of his tardiness, plus the silence from his end of the line led me to an obvious conclusion, something had happened to him. As the minutes had piled on my markings began to burn more and more, the reaction triggered by my worry and fear, it got to a point where I barely dared to move, the pain was too sharp.
            </p>
            <P>A few meters away from me the bulb from a street lamp exploded sending a shower of broken glass and plastic to the floor, but I hardly paid it any mind, too preoccupied with thoughts of my father, and all the awful things that could have happened to him.
            </P>
            <br>
            <P>“What if he had died?”The thought was so distressing it made my markings erupt into a fresh wave of pain, like somebody had set my skin on fire, I felt nauseous from worry and fear, my hand closing on around the edge of the concrete bench and shattering it. Another street lamp exploded and I vaguely wondered if I was doing that, but I quickly discarded the thought, I had never done anything of the sort, no reason why I would start doing it now all of a sudden.  
            </P>
            <p>Nervously I wondered if I should just go look for Daenerys and ask her for help, before we had parted ways at the end of the day she had told me she, and most of the kids from the acting club, would be staying a few more hours after school to practice.
            </p>
            <P>Only one hour had passed from the end of classes, so she, and probably Jake, were still there, I wasn’t sure what they could do to help me, but in this situation probably more than me, if anything, they could at least advise me on what I should do. Before today, in my phone, there had only been two contacts, my father’s number, and another mysterious one he had registered there the moment he gave me the phone, he hadn’t told me who it was, and the only thing I could figure out from looking at it was that it was from somewhere out of the U.S since it had the code +299 at the beginning.
            </P>
            <P>He had very firmly told me that I should only call that number in emergencies and that I should obey whatever the person who picked up told me, I had tried to ask him more about it but he had refused to elaborate. Well… if there ever was an emergency this sure as hell felt like it but... I hesitated, my finger hovering over the strange number,  there was the very real possibility that I was blowing this way out of proportion, I'm sure this was a normal experience for most kids, their parents taking more than the usual time to pick them up because there was traffic or because they got held up at work.
            </P>
            <p>Except I had never seen my father work, he was always at home with me, the most he did was go to the grocery store and in most cases, he ordered our groceries online so they would be delivered right to our doorstep, which allowed him to keep his eyes on me at all times.
            </p>
            <P>Now that I thought about it, where did my father even get all our money? How could we afford to move around so much buying houses in every city? How did he pay for our expenses? The cars that he constantly kept changing making sure he always had the last model? The more I sat there, the more things about my life just didn’t make sense, and I began questioning everything. Why did I have these abilities? Was I some sort of freak science experiment? The product of a mutation? Was I even human?
            </P>
            <P>There were just so many questions and I had no answers. Until now I had lived in my happy little bubble, in a world that only included my father, who was just like me, so I never questioned it, for me it was normal, but now? Now I realize just how little I knew, just how little I had questioned my entire life.
            </P>
            <p>A third and then a fourth street lamp exploded in rapid succession as I felt more panic rise in my chest, my fingers tremble over the list of numbers in my phone that now included Danerys, Jake’s, and the contacts of all the other kids I had sat with today at lunch, they had insisted on putting their number on my phone, and saving saved mine.
            </p>
            <br>
            <P>I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood as I anxiously looked at my screen, unsure of what to do, call one of my new friends, or call the mysterious number? If I had been in this situation even a day ago I would have called the number in a heartbeat, but today...I was now so full of doubts, questioning everything. The other numbers in my phone had names,  and above anything a face, a real person I could associate them to. I knew who would pick up when I called; but that number, that mysterious person, I had no idea who they were.
            </P>
            <P>I took several deep breaths trying to calm myself, otherwise I would end up crushing the phone despite its thick black cover...I need to think straight, to make a decision… Again my thoughts wandered towards my father, the person I loved and trusted the most in this world, the only family I had...the thought that something horrible may have happened to him weighed down on my chest, and with it the responsibility of obeying him. He had kept me safe all this time, even if he wasn’t here right now he was still trying to protect me, that number was his way to ensure that I would always be safe...even if we were apart. I still had doubts, questions swimming around my mind, but I had made my decision.
            </P>
            <p>With new found urgency I clicked the mysterious contact and was about to make the call when I heard it, the familiar sound of our car engine quickly coming towards me. The sound brought such a wave of relief over me I almost fainted; I never thought hearing that trucks’ diesel engine could make me so happy, but more than the soft purr of the motor was what came with it.My dad’s heartbeat, his scent, it all came along with the car that came to a stop in front of me a few minutes later,  I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Despite the lingering pain on my skin I felt like I was floating as I walked towards the black pick up truck, dizzy with relief.
                </p>
            <P>“Dad”, I whispered, as soon as I opened the car door, practically throwing myself at him, trying to give him a hug. Before I could touch him however, I stopped short, as another scent hit me, it was faint, covered my bleach and other strong cleaning products, but I could still detect it. Blood, dad 's blood, there had been lots of it spill everywhere, its scent having seeped into the fabric of the seats, specially the drivers one. “Dad!”, I said, turning to examine him alarmed, my worry coming back stronger than ever, “You are hurt!”.
            </P>
            <P>He only sighed, tirely rubbing his forehead, “I told Lionel didn't I? This won’t be enough to mask the scent; but did he pay me any mind? No of course not.”. He muttered under his breath, hardly acknowledging my worry, or that I was even there, I had never heard him talk to himself and never had he so openly ignored me. “Dad what are you going on about?”, I asked confused and worried, “Why… why does the car reek of your blood?”.  
            </P>
            <p>He didn’t even look at me, just sat almost perfectly still, holding on to the wheel with tightened fists, his eyes seeming disoriented. “Dad!”, I said,  alarmed, shaking his arm, trying to get his attention. Finally his face turned towards me, he looked pale, tired, but still, as he saw me, a flash of recognition passed through his grey eyes. “Asher”, he said like he had just realized I was there as he grabbed my shoulders, his eyes anxiously examining me, “Are you okay?”, he asked, his usual collected tone urgent, “Did anything happen at school?...Did you see any suspicious looking person, anybody strange?”.  His tone, and the flood of questions surprised me, “What? No… No I'm fine”, I assure him, “I did meet some people...but...they were all normal kids”.
            </p>
            <br>
            <P>Well, as normal as you can get hanging out with the theater kids but I didn’t mention that part.
                Now that he was closer I could smell fresh blood on him, it was faint, a lot more concealed than the one that had been spilled on the car, but it was there. “Your arm is hurt”, I said, sniffing a few times, “The left one”. His eyes widened slightly, “You could detect that?”he asked, sounding genuinely surprised, but mostly concerned. “Um...yeah?”I asked more than responded, not sure why that would be surprising, or news to him, he also had a good sense of smell. He passes a hand through his hair, his eyes wandering past me and towards the bench where I had been sitting, and all the broken street lamps.
                </P>
            <P>“Was that like that when you got there?”, he asked, looking from the lamps, to the bench to me.
                I frowned, “No...it happened while I was waiting for you....probably some electrical malfunction”.
                He cursed under his breath, something he seldomly did as he let me go and grabbed the wheel again. “Your arm?” I persistently asked, as he seemed to come to a decision and pressed the accelerator, pushing the car forward and toward the exit from the now almost empty school parking lot. He shook his head, “It's nothing Asher, I'm fine”, he said, his tone and mannerisms back to normal. “It doesn’t smell fine”, I counter, which didn’t get even a reaction out of him.
                </P>
            <p> “What happened dad?” I asked, practically pleading for him to give me some answers, “Please… I was so worried”. My words seem to soften his expression a little, “Asher… it's better if you don't know. I promise one day, probably very soon, I'll explain everything, but for now, all you should know is that our plan worked, you went undetected, for at least the time being, you should be safe and that is all that matters”. His answers only brought more questions forward, but his tone and expression made it clear that no matter how much I pestered him, he wouldn't  be providing a complete or even partial explanation.
            </p>
            <P>“Can I at least see your arm?”, I asked, by the smell of it I could tell it had been a deep wound, and that worried me, I wanted to make sure he was okay. At first it looked like he was ignoring my request but after a while he sighed, “Fine, I'll show it to you as soon as we get the chance”. It was a small victory but it was better than nothing, and I finally began to relax, loosening all the muscle I hadn't realized had been knotted together with anxiety.
            </P>
            <P>Looking out the window and at the other vehicle I realized we weren’t taking the usual route home, I had memorized it on our way to school that morning, instead we were going in the opposite direction, out of the suburbs and into the heart of the city. “Um...dad?”, I asked, “Where are we going?”. He looked at me, steering with his right hand, “Well it's your birthday”, he began, “I hadn’t forgotten Asher, I just thought this year we should do something different, go out to eat...with all the people in this city masking our trail we should be safe…”.

            </P>
            <p>I almost couldn’t believe what I was hearing, my dad willingly taking me outside? like to eat at a restaurant? it was insane, maybe he had lost a little too much blood… Usually on my birthday he would cook my favorite food for me plus get me a cake, he never sang happy birthday to me, and honestly it would have been awkward considering he was the only person there...but I never cared, he was enough for me. Apart from the food there was also always a gift, a big one,  somehow he always managed to know exactly what I wanted.
            </p>
            <P>Today had been so chaotic I had forgotten all about my birthday, but he hadn't, a reminder of just how much he cared for me. “I… really?” I asked, not believing this could be happening.
                A smile tugged at his lips, “Hmmm? Yeap”. Questions and doubts still bounced around in my mind, but slowly they were becoming less and less oppressive, my head getting occupied with other thoughts, happier ones, I was safe, dad looked mostly unharmed, and he had promised me I wasn’t in danger. This had probably been the craziest birthday ever, I had gone through the biggest emotional roller coaster of my life, felt so much fear and anguish,  but as we drove towards the city, I still hoped we could, at least, end it on a positive note.
                </P>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <P>I looked down, horrified, at the mess that was my dad's shoulder. Much as I had suspected, the wound was deep, but I hadn’t expected this. There was a hole through his shoulder and chest as big as my fist, the wound had been violently made, and had irregular edges. After more close examination it almost looked like something made by a harpoon, it had shot him from behind and ripped the flesh away as he struggled to get free. The thought was sickening, that something like that may have happened to my father, worst off, even if it was that big it should have been at least halfway close by now, but the wound looked almost flesh, with only minimal signs of healing.
            </P>
            <p>“Dad…” I whispered, trying to stop my voice from shaking, “What happened to you? Why aren’t you healing?”. He sighed, getting up from the stool, and moving over the bathroom sink, were the bandages that had been previously wrapping the wound laid. “As I told you Ahser…”, he began, grabbing the bandages, “It's better if you don't know.” He said, sitting down on the stool again. “But, just keep one thing in mind… The people who did this to me would do much worse to you if they got the chance, so be careful at school, keep your eyes open for anybody suspicious”.
            </p>
            <P>Immediately I knew what he meant by that, from the moment I had told him about my new friends as we ate, he had looked worried, had asked me a lot about them, even going so far as to ask me to describe them  in detail, seeming even more concern as I told him just how easily they had accepted me into their fold. Several times through diner he had told me to be careful of strangers, to avoid getting too close to anybody and avoid anybody who acted too friendly.  Although he didn’t explicitly said it, I still caught his meaning - he didn’t like Daenerys, Jake or any of the other kids, and he especially didn’t like that they had been so friendly towards me.
            </P>
            <P>I wanted to argue with him, to defend my new friends, the only people in hundreds who had been willing to help me out, but just in that moment all the waiters from the restaurant had appeared, one of them carrying a piece of cake with a candle. What followed was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life, apparently my dad, in an act of treason, had  informed the restaurant it was my birthday. That was the first time somebody sang happy birthday to me, and hopefully the last, I would rather die than go through that again, especially when some of the other tables around us clapped as I blew the candles, some going so far as to get up and congratulating me.
            </P>
            <p>My dad had looked innocent during the entire thing, like he was just as surprised by all the fuss over me, however I did see him recording the event, especially my face the moment I realized the waiters were very much coming towards us. In those moments I probably received more attention from a complete stranger than I had in my entire life, and had been too stunned to even think about arguing with my father, not until now, that we were back home, and I began helping him to dress the deep ugly wound on his shoulder. 
            </p>
            <P>I wasn’t sure whether we should be reusing the bandages but he had been incistant and as I wrapped them around his arm and shoulder I noticed that they glowed slightly, a soft bluish color, oddly enough they also masked the scent of blood, way more than any normal bandage should, probably why the full smell of his wound hadn’t hit me until I took them away.
            </P>
            <br>
            <P>“When will you start healing?” I asked, trying to be as gentle as possible while I worked. “Probably in a few hous.” He said, providing me with no explanation as to why his healing seemed to be languishing. “Will you be okay?”, I asked for what must have been the hundredth time. I couldn't see his face, since I was standing behind him,  but I could still feel as he slightly flinched as I tightened the bandages, “Yes Asher…”, he assured me, “I'll be fine”. With a sigh of relief I finished wraping the bandages, the smell of his blood now almost completely gone from the air.
            </P>
            <p>He turned to look at me, his face still pale; “Asher,” he began, “I'm not telling you to not talk to people, or to be a loner, but promise me you will be carefull, don't let anybody get you alone, always stay in as much of a crowded area as you can. If you can do that, you should be okay”. He made a motion towards his injured shoulder, the bandages covering most of his marking that spread from the back of his neck, around his shoulder and arm, and ending just before his elbow. “This is what they are capable of doing to us”, he said. “I don't want to see you get hurt or worse.” Of Course he didn’t tell me how they were but only the way he said it was enough to make a shudder go down my spine.
                </p>
            <P>His words, conbined with his concerned face, were enough to bring the fight out of me, any arguments I had wanted to make on behalf of the kids I had met today going out the window.
            Not being alone with anybody, staying in the crowds, that shouldn't be too hard, and I could still have friends, if they truly cared about me they wouldn't make me do anything I didn’t want to right? And if they tried to force me, I would take it as a warning sign. “I'll be carefull,” I said; “I promise.” In that moment I wanted to hug him but I was scared of causing him pain because of his injury, he, however, didn’t seem to care, as he brought me forward with his good arm, the familiar warmth and scent of his body comforting me as I, gently, returned the hug, feeling safe in his arms. “I love you Asher”, he whispered. I hugged him tighter; “I love you too dad”.
            </P>
            <P>Looking back now, I wished I could have stretched that moment forever, that moment of peace and quiet, feeling completely safe with my dad’s strong arms wrapped protectively around me, if only I had known what the next few weeks had in store for me, I would have hugged him for longer… But I didn’t know, neither of us knew just how much our lives would be turned upside down during the next few weeks, just how much pain was waiting for us.
            </P>
